## Hi there!

Nice to meet you! I'm Elysia. I'm currently a full-time software engineer but I've always had an interest in cybersecurity. In particular I'd like to get more technical, hands-on practice with hacking/pentesting and eventually do some CTFs down the line.<br>
While I'm not code-monkeying away, some other hobbies I enjoy are gaming, ceramics, reading, letting the days go by, letting the water hold me down, letting the days go by, water flowing underground,

<em>
  
Into the blue again \
After the money's gone \
Once in a lifetime! \
Water flowing underground

Same as it ever was \
Same as it ever was \
Same as it ever was \
[Same as it ever was...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8)
